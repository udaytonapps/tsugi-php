Built in 1870 by Brother Max Zehler, then the president of U.D., it was originally called \"Zehler's Folly\" due to doubts about its size and cost. However, the Marianist's forward-thinking prevailed, making it the largest building in Dayton at the time. Over the years, St. Mary's Hall has served various purposes, from classrooms to a residence for the brothers, and now houses important administrative offices. The building is a living testament to the university's past, with historic photos adorning its walls and the original metal plates still on its steps, bearing the name \"St. Mary's Institute.\" Join us in this video as we explore the rich heritage and enduring significance of St. Mary's Hall in the life of the University of Dayton."
