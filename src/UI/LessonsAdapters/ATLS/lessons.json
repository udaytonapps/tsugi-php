          "<p>The Advancing Teaching & Learning Scholars Program (ATLS) was launched by the LTC in 2022 to support faculty in advancing the University of Dayton’s Marianist teaching mission. Education in the Marianist spirit is a sacred duty for us all and, if done well, positions our graduates to become the lifelong learners that we want them to be and that our world needs.</p>",
          "<p>The core ATLS program comprises eight sessions designed to introduce instructors to campus resources, pedagogy strategies, and timely teaching topics to increase teaching and learning effectiveness for instructors and students. These engaging 90-minute, in-person sessions are delivered by UD’s expert instructors and staff and ATLS sessions and may be taken in any order.</p>",
          "<h5>Program Goals</h5>",
          "<ol><li>Increase faculty knowledge about UD students and their learning needs, campus resources, and teaching strategies</li><li>Expose faculty to services and people within the LTC as a support center for their continuing professional development at UD</li><li>Connect faculty with one another and key campus colleagues to build communities of practice and commitment to the institution</li></ol>",
