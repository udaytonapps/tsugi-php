The actual percentage of LGBTQ+ individuals in our community is surely higher. The sessions in this program explore information and best practices that are essential to LGBTQ+ in educational spaces.</p>",
            "<p>The University of Dayton’s approach to LGBTQ+ inclusion at UD is grounded in our Catholic, Marianist mission – which includes honoring the intrinsic value of all people and fostering a community where all people feel respected as children of God. This rationale stems from our mission as a university where rigorous intellectual inquiry and vigorous dialogue occur.
